                            If it were a verbal explanation, it would sound something like this:<br>
                            Person one asks, "What's your favourite restaurant in the city?"<br>
                            Person two responds by saying, "Gusto. It's an Italian spot near King that has tasty food and a great vibe."<br><br>
                            "Gusto." would be the primary response. The support text is, "It's an Italian spot near King that has tasty food and a great vibe."<br>

                            In the UI UX sense here's what this looks like:

                            When we talk about screen real estate, we often consider how much content we need in order communicate something effectively. The question I always ask is, "What is the minimum amount of words that we need here to explain this thing?"<br><br>
                            Shortest isn't always the best option, but it's a good place to start because if it's concise and it's intelligible then you're winning.
                            <br><br>
                            Length isn't the only thing to consider when it comes to text content on your pages. There are consequences to every little detail when it comes to what content appears, and how that content is formatted, in the viewport on page load.<br>

                        • Are there too many items for a user to take in?<br><br>
                        • Is the content within these items too long for a user to take in? - or maybe too short to really understand?<br><br>
                        • What font size is the content in each of these items?<br><br>
                        • Is the content in each of these items coherent and intelligible?<br><br>
                        • Is the content legible? Does it meet WCAG standards?

                        Most times the question that naturally comes next is, "Do we even need this content at all?"<br><br>
                        This question is deceptively complex. Content is almost always the one thing that everyone has an opinion on, so it always results in this tug of war between what it should say, how long it should be, and whether we even need it at all - or said otherwise, "Does the primary text here do a good enough job of explaining what this thing is?"

                        On top of this we have one more question - maybe the most common question because OBBVIOUSLY we need more content - can we hide it? throw it in a tool tip or present it as-is up front? That's what I want to think about today...

                        The workplace reminds me of those video games where your different responses to people in conversations have consequential ripple effects. By relying on your manager more you’re relinquishing a bit of autonomy, but think of it as boosting your stability and efficiency skill points in the game. 
                        <br></br>
                        Your manager should be your shield and your spear, but you are the body - the controller - that needs to know where to point them.
